TODO

- RAII
    - implement resource release
- libkoala interface
    - CmId::connect()
    - CmIdListener::bind()
    - CmIdListener::incoming()
    - CmIdListener::accept()
- shmem-ipc
    - Error::Disconnected
    - remove the blocking send/recv
    - expose current available count to read/write
- Thread-safety
    - Add spinlock to QueuePair, CompletionQueue...
- GetSendComp() is busy spin
- overlapped memory registration (two non-overlapped regions sharing one
  virtual page), currently, we just avoid this in the example code.
- balance poll_cq and post_send/recv, reduce redundant poll_cq
    - use seperate queues can work, but still can cause HOL among
      multiple CQs
