TODO

Engine Framework
- Blocking network APIs in transport engine may block the entire runtime
- What should Engine::run() return?

Resource Releasing
- implement resource release (partially done)
-[x] Finally find a solution to deal with Fd/Handle that can come from
     everywhere: use explicit open/close call to update the reference 
     count of the corresponding object at the backend.
- Clean and release the resource after detected a user app is
  disconnected.
	- shmem-ipc
		- Error::Disconnected
		-[x] remove the blocking send/recv
		-[x] expose current available count to read/write

Performance & CPU efficiency
-[x] Use FnvHashMap in transport/engine
-[x] Change to Ordering::Relaxed
-[x] Control path is too slow
- GetSendComp() is currently busy spinning
- Save CPU cycles in TransportEngine::run()
-[x] balance poll_cq and post_send/recv, reduce redundant poll_cq
    - <s>use seperate queues can work, but still can cause HOL among
      multiple CQs</s>

Thread-safety
- Add spinlock to QueuePair, CompletionQueue... in libkoala
- Most of the resources in transport/engine should be per-user, lock
  or concurrent data structure is needed
- Move CqBuffer from thread_local to lazy_static
- Write a multi-threaded program to test the correctness

Misc
- Remove repeatitive code in libkoala/cm.rs
- Add AsHandle Trait so that open_or_create_resource can do sanity check
- Also implement handle for CmId, use the pointer as the identifier.
- Handle conn_param
- Add lifetime constraint to CmId in rdmacm library
- update all `trace!`s in TransportEngine::process_cmd

Memory Registration
-[x] Overlapped memory registration (two non-overlapped regions sharing
     one virtual page), currently, we just avoid this in the example code.
-[x] Couple memory allocation and registration
	-[x] Owned MemoryRegion
	-[x] Type-safe memory region and post_send/recv
-[x] Check if it is possible to avoid rounding up to page

libkoala interface
    -[x] CmId::connect()
    -[x] CmIdListener::bind()
    -[x] CmIdListener::incoming()
    -[x] CmIdListener::accept()
