Potential Compatibility Issue

- Providing C API with high level abstraction.
    - break RAII into construction and destruction.
    - Rust recommends that object should avoid intermediate state
        e.g. TcpStream::connect(), UnixDatagram::bind() will return
        immediately usable socket.
- Some structures, flags are not fully supported yet.
    - ibv_wc
    - ibv_send_flags
    - ibv_wc_status
- Some RNIC supported operations has not been supported.
    - read/write
    - atomic
    - other
- Some rdmacm/ibv functions has not been supported.
    - rdma_set_option
    - ibv
- CompletionQueue is !Sync or !Send, but in reality, it should be
Sync and Send, so as QueuePair and CmId.
    - Protect every structure with spinlock.
    - Maybe try some NUMA-aware MCS spinlock.
- Many compile time guarantees will be broken on the FFI boundary.
